It is with a heavy heart that I inform you that I will be leaving my position at the
company effective 2021-02-16T00:00:00Z. This decision was made based on the need to focus
on my health and personal growth and well-being. I have greatly valued my time spent working for
Amazon's loyal customers, it's tenacious stakeholders, and with it's excellent employees.
I am grateful for having had the chance to work with such amazing people, and I have and
will always cherish my time spent with the company. Even as I intend to stop maintaining a
employee position at the company, I will always be an evangelist of Amazon's services and a customer at heart.

I will do anything I can to help with the transition. If I can be of any assistance during
the transition, please let me know.
