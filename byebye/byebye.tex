It is with a heavy heart that I elect to inform you that I will be leaving my position at the company effective 2021-02-16T00:00:00Z. I have greatly valued my time spent working for Amazon's loyal customers, it's tenacious stakeholders, and with it's excellent employees. I utterly grateful for having gotten the chance to work with such amazing people as I have and will always cherish my time spent with the company. Even as I intend to stop mainting a employee position at the company I think I will always be an evangalist of it's services and a customer at heart.
