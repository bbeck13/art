\section{Genesis}

To think it all began with \textit{suspected} phony twenty dollar bill. Well not really, it actually began over thirteen billion years ago when a disgusting mutant creature crawled out of the primordial ooze and hollered ``I am God! And I don't care for \textit{queers}''. To the dismay and anguish of all the only way for \textit{God's} disgusting mutant creatures to continue existence was via sexual reproduction, i.e. sans \textit{queerness}. So time and time again the proverbial Adam shacked up with the proverbial Eve who birthed more disgusting mutant creatures each more opposed to \textit{queers} than the last. Eventually it came to be that one particularly homophobic sect of humanity decided that they didn't particularly like erecting phallus like structures under the rule of the oft topless Pharaoh who loved himself a good catamite\footnote{If you don't know what this is lets just say it's what those naughty Greeks liked to do.}. This sect then Exodus'd\footnote{the Bible not the Bob Marley LP} away from the Pharaoh, out of Africa\footnote{\emoji{musical-note} movement of Jah people \emoji{musical-note}}, and wandered though the desert all the while become more and more intolerant of some of the best parts of life. Things like queerness, infidelity, and murder. They grew to hate these things so much that they had their opposition to them then write in stone and called them the ten commandments. Eventually they settled down in the area that we now call the middle east and like their forefathers had schism\footnote{Not the Tool single but a separation of peoples much like how the original sect separated from the Pharaohs people and became the Israelite's} after schism.

A beginning\footnote{as in Genesis we're talking strictly cannon here so put away the book of Enoch if you will for now perhaps we will discuss the Apocrypha another day as it is very important in it's own right as are all things non Biblical} is a very delicate time. Know then, that it is the year of our Lord 2024. The known universe is ruled by the Racist Bigot Oligarch Joseph R. Biden\footnote{the R. stands for Racist}, not my president. In this time the most precious substance in the universe is petroleum. Petroleum extends life. Petroleum expands society. A product of petroleum, gasoline, burns in great engines and releases noxious gasses into the atmosphere but allows these engines to do work that would require enumerable man hours, as slavery has been outlawed\footnote{to think if the Pharaohs had harnessed petroleum perhaps the Israelite's would have never come to be}. Oh, yes. I forgot to tell you. Petroleum is primary made up of hydrocarbons, the very same substance that the disgusting mutant creatures called humans\footnote{also know as Israelite's} are made of, and so it is that life as it is today relies blasting away the mountain of death and decay that came before it. Life, and consequently petroleum, exists on only one planet in the know universe. A desolate, dry planet with vast deserts. Hidden away within the rocks of these deserts are a people known as the Israelite's, who have long held a prophecy that a man would come, a messiah, who would lead them to true freedom. The planet is Earth, also known as the home of Zion.

Zion, the land of Israel. Home to the Israelite's. Or at least it used to be. Currently the land is mired in conflict\footnote{turmoil, term oil.}. You see since the discovery of the powers of Petroleum the great powers of the world have struggled to maintain control over it's extraction from the earth. As it so happens the lands near Zion are rich with oil and this peaked the interests of the decaying British Empire. And so they sent one of their own to the Land of Israel. Not a messiah but a very naughty boy\footnote{From the comedy troupe Monty Python, perhaps the only good thing the British have ever created.} named Thomas Edward Lawrence. Since the Israelite's first arrived in Israel thousands of years ago a lot had changed. There had been many conflicts, messianic figures, schisms, crusades, and jihads. He found a land ruled by the Ottoman Empire and a people oppressed by it's military and industrial ambitions. The petroleum must flow. Lawrence led a particularly combat adept group of these people know as the Bedouin to victory against their oppressors. Perhaps it was their reverence towards him or their weakened state after facing down one of the most powerful empires in the world that made it particularly easy for the British Empire to take control over the land that once was called Israel and secure access to the Petroleum rich region. Perhaps the region was so rich with petroleum because of the thousands of years of continuous human habitation. How many countless lives lay beneath those sands. Certainly enough to fuel the automobiles of the British that drove on the wrong side of the road. In any case the focus now shifts back to the Israelite's.

\section{Exodus and DNA}

Like any particularly homophobic peoples the Israelite's reproduced and many of their offspring left the land of Zion and went out into the wide world. Where did they go? In modern times we have only just begun to unravel this mystery of human migration and mutation. We've done this through our understanding of a little squiggly thing that lives in all of us. We call it deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA for short. This DNA is what forces humanity to reproduce sexually, yes even the very microns of our being are homophobic all thanks to that original disgusting mutant who called himself \textit{God}. This DNA is in fact what enabled \textit{God} to mutate into being in the first place. It carries genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses. Though DNA hydrocarbons can be formed into a living breathing thing like T.E. Lawrence or the Pharaoh or even George Floyd\footnote{even though he couldn't live and breath in the end}. By looking very closely at this double helix in fossil records from tar pits filled petroleum and comparing it with helices from modern day people we are able to understand how though mistakes in copying called \textit{mutations} all the modern types of people came to exist.

Perhaps it is because we long for familiar explanations, or perhaps it is because our disgusting mutant ancestors who wrote such things as the Torah, the Bible, and the Qur'an where more knowledgeable than we like to give them credit, whatever the case the scientific consensus is that humanity did in fact come out of Africa and across the sea just as the ancient Israelite's claimed they had. From there the human Diaspora spread out far and wide as did it's knowledge. With the advent of the written word mans ideas could travel farther than any one individual, and a lot faster too. So it was that the stories the Israelite's had written and even the homophobic commandments written in stone traveled far and wide across the earth. As did their DNA. Unlike the written word which can be copied millions of times without error DNA can't and so we live in a world with many different equally disgusting mutant creatures we call humans.

The texts of the Israelite's where preserved and turned into what we know today as religion. One sect of this religion called itself Judaism and it's followers called themselves Jews, borrowing the name of the tribe of Judah from the texts. Judaism necessarily spread faster than the Israelite's ever could and before you know it across the world there were people who identified themselves as Jews. Some where so adherent that they insisted they where geologically Jewish. That is to say they claimed that their DNA had mutated directly from the DNA of those first Israelite's who had gone out of Africa to Zion so long ago. Of course until very recently it was impossible to prove or disprove this claim so it has gone unchecked for millennia. So to no ones particular surprise it went again unchecked when the British empire stumbled it's way to control over the land of Israel and it's peoples. People who as Lawrence saw firsthand where capable or driving out an Empire like themselves. They needed a subservient population in there to maintain there economic interests in the reason. To ensure that the petroleum flowed. Unlike other areas of the globe colonization by the British themselves was right out. It seems the desert was too hot for T.E. Lawrence and others who neglected to settle the area and instead returned to the motherland. For a moment there was no easy way out. They couldn't let the natives control the land the British has coerced them to fight and die for. And they couldn't establish a colony where it was too hot for the British colonists to enjoy themselves. It was precisely then that two particularly naughty Brits got an Idea. An awful idea. The Brits had a wonderful, \textit{awful} idea.

\section{The Liberal Colonies}

Their names were Author Balfor and Lionel Walter Rothschild and they didn't like the idea of the savages that Lawrence had led into battle now controlling their rightful clay one bit. After all Rothschild himself was an adherent of Judaism and, like his forefathers, asserted that he was mutated from the same Israelite's that had fled the Pharaohs liberal regime that approved of such things as infidelity and slavery. Despite the fact the he and his family had been forming and financing the liberal wing of the British Empire and carrying out the very same acts of tyranny Israelite's had fled from. This assertion allowed him to issue a call to action to all Europeans like himself, liberal aristocracy who belived that their roots came from Zion. With the help from Balfor, then foreign sectary for the British Empire, and in no small part thanks to the turmoil unfolding in Europe know that would be latter know as the World Wars, Rothschild presided over the establishment what was called in the declaration "a national home for the Jewish people". Clever, because the population of the area was predominately adherents to Islam\footnote{a religion that resulted as product of multiple schisms however they still recognize the texts of the Israelite's as holy scripture} this gave anyone who called themselves a \textit{Jewish person} permission to colonize the land and drive out the natives. If only America's own founding fathers had come up with such a dastardly plan\footnote{someone later did and his name was Joesph Smith}.
