Some 62 years after publication of it's source material, the film \textit{Lawrence of Arabia}, and 98 years after the publication of that source materials source material, T.E. Lawrence's heavily self righteous and grotesquely embellished \textit{Seven Pillars of Wisdom}, we are again presented with a white nationalist interpretation of middle eastern affairs.\footnote{The reader will note that the term 'middle east' is itself euro-centrist nomenclature.}

Aside from the sand worms this new entry in the goon\footnote{as I've taken to calling it} franchise seems to completely ignore the actual ip\footnote{intellectual property,} the only real things that Frank Herbert imagined up, and instead focuses back on his sources. No guild navigators as seen in David Lynch's masterpiece\footnote{\href{https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/}{https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/} truely one of the films of all time} no mention of CHOAM\footnote{do not CHOAM}\footnote{Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles} or any other worldly politics that really flesh out the narrative. No floding space from IX no fun allowed it seems.

 It is largely because of this choice of focus that this entry more than any previous embodies the tired and racist themes of white saviorism, Zionism, colonialism etc.

The cast is so white. Even the star fremen Dick Cheney\footnote{yes that's how Herbert pronounced it look it up} is played by an actress of European\footnote{and Nigerian} descent. The only cast members who have any middle eastern descent are cast as unnamed pawns many of whom are sacrificed in the same way T.E. Lawrence used his 'White boi suave' to convince the Bedouin's\footnote{see editors note} to throw themselves atop the spears of the Ottomans so that his counterparts in the British Empire could come in and suck up all the oil in the mid east before establishing such contemporary fixtures as Israel, Zionism, and Mandatory Palestine. In this Film the Bedouin (fremen) leaders are all European, Zendya, Javier Bardem, etc so even the white savior (Timhouthi Chalamet\footnote{sadly not the Yemeni rebel but the sniveling Frenchman}) is saving the Bedouin (fremen) from the leadership of other white people. I couldn't think of a more racist plot if held under the gom jabbar.

Perhaps even more blatant than the white washing of the cast is the white washing of the script. Language is very important to the narrative of the story, and when nouns are borrowed from such rich sources as the Qur'an omitting certain motifs and words sticks out even more than the white cast against the middle east backdrop. Removing all references to jihad and holy war is so September the 12th\footnote{\href{https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2020/10/11/paul-atreides-led-a-jihad-not-a-crusade-heres-why-that-matters/}{https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2020/10/11/paul-atreides-led-a-jihad-not-a-crusade-heres-why-that-matters/} Jihad matters}. Replacing it with the word crusade is just the cherry on top of this oh so white sundae. While the film aims to be secular it's painfully Christian nationalist motifs are glaring.

In conclusion and in protest I have not and will not be seeing the film and I will be purchasing the lego ornithopter and coloring all the mini-figures brown\footnote{\href{https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/dune-atreides-royal-ornithopter-10327}{https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/dune-atreides-royal-ornithopter-10327} The Palestinians won't be able to hide from this}.

\noindent Editors note:

Unlike the Palestinians the modern Negev Bedouin are granted Israeli citizenship and, thanks to Israels fascist laws aimed at propping up their white birth rate, are subsidized by the government for each child they have. This has led the modern Bedouin to constantly make the Zionists seethe by kidnapping and impregnating women for profit accruing large harems and and endless supply of child soldiers all funded by the Israeli government. This is, dare I say, baste\footnote{a la Berkeley social media personality Little B the Based God} af.
