1 (obvious): Excuse me.  Is that your nose or did a bus park on your face?
2 (meteorological): Everybody take cover.  She's going to blow.
3 (fashionable): You know, you could de-emphasize your nose if you wore something larger.  Like ... Wyoming.
4 (personal): Well, here we are.  Just the three of us.
5 (punctual): Alright gentlemen.  Your nose was on time but you were fifteen minutes late.
6 (envious): Oooo, I wish I were you.  Gosh.  To be able to smell your own ear.
7 (naughty): Pardon me, Sir.  Some of the ladies have asked if you wouldn't mind putting that thing away.
8 (philosophical): You know.  It's not the size of a nose that's important. It's what's in it that matters.
9 (humorous): Laugh and the world laughs with you.  Sneeze and it's goodbye, Seattle.
10 (commercial): Hi, I'm Earl Schibe and I can paint that nose for $39.95.
11 (polite): Ah.  Would you mind not bobbing your head.  The orchestra keeps changing tempo.
12 (melodic): Everybody! "He's got the whole world in his nose."

With women, I've got a long bamboo pole with a leather loop on the end of
it.  I slip the loop around their necks so they can't get away or come too
close.  Like catching snakes.

"Though a program be but three lines long,

There is nothing wrong with abstinence, in moderation. The public demands certainties;
The public demands certainties;  it must be told definitely and a bit raucously that this
is true and that is false.  But there are no certainties. -- H.L. Mencken, "Prejudice" On
a tous un peu peur de l'amour, mais on a surtout peur de souffrir ou de faire souffrir.

    pain.]

    	A novice asked the master: "I perceive that one computer company is
much larger than all others.  It towers above its competition like a giant
among dwarfs.  Any one of its divisions could comprise an entire business.
Why is this so?"
	The master replied, "Why do you ask such foolish questions?  That
company is large because it is so large.  If it only made hardware, nobody
would buy it.  If it only maintained systems, people would treat it like a
servant.  But because it combines all of these things, people think it one
of the gods!  By not seeking to strive, it conquers without effort."
                -- Geoffrey James, "The Tao of Programming"

Suffering alone exists, none who suffer;
The deed there is, but no doer thereof;
Nirvana is, but no one is seeking it;
The Path there is, but none who travel it.

"The clerics and their lay allies commonly tell us, that if we refuse to admit that there
is good ground for expressing definite convictions about certain topics, the bonds of
human society will dissolve and mankind lapse into savagery. There are several answers to
this assertion. One is that the bonds of human society were formed without the aid of
their theology; and, in the opinion of not a few competent judges, have been weakened
rather than strengthened by a good deal of it. Greek science, Greek art, the ethics of old
Israel, the social organisation of old Rome, contrived to come into being, without the
help of any one who believed in a single distinctive article of the simplest of the
Christian creeds. The science, the art, the jurisprudence, the chief political and social
theories, of the modern world have grown out of those of Greece and Rome-not by favour of,
but in the teeth of, the fundamental teachings of early Christianity, to which science,
art, and any serious occupation with the things of this world, were alike despicable."

        There was once a programmer who was attached to the court of the
warlord of Wu.  The warlord asked the programmer: "Which is easier to design:
an accounting package or an operating system?"
        "An operating system," replied the programmer.
        The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief.  "Surely an
accounting package is trivial next to the complexity of an operating
system," he said.
        "Not so," said the programmer, "when designing an accounting package,
the programmer operates as a mediator between people having different ideas:
how it must operate, how its reports must appear, and how it must conform to
the tax laws.  By contrast, an operating system is not limited my outside
appearances.  When designing an operating system, the programmer seeks the
simplest harmony between machine and ideas.  This is why an operating system
is easier to design."
        The warlord of Wu nodded and smiled.  "That is all good and well, but
which is easier to debug?"
        The programmer made no reply.
                -- Geoffrey James, "The Tao of Programming"

Come, every frustum longs to be a cone,
And every vector dreams of matrices.
Hark to the gentle gradient of the breeze:
It whispers of a more ergodic zone.

If you resist reading what you disagree with, how will you ever acquire
deeper insights into what you believe?  The things most worth reading
are precisely those that challenge our convictions.

The Sage

Honest people use no rhetoric;
Rhetoric is not honesty.
Enlightened people are not cultured;
Culture is not enlightenment.
Content people are not wealthy;
Wealth is not contentment.
So the sage does not serve himself;
The more he does for others, the more he is satisfied;
The more he gives, the more he receives.
Nature flourishes at the expense of no one;
So the sage benefits all men and contends with none.
		-- Lao Tse, "Tao Te Ching"
